/**
@see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/#max-width
Why subtract .02px? Browsers donâ€™t currently support range context queries,
so we work around the limitations of min- and max- prefixes and viewports
with fractional widths (which can occur under certain conditions on high-dpi
devices, for instance) by using values with higher precision.
